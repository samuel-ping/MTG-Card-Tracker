1. If collection already contains card name, but different expansion, make new card
2. Store collection into a text file
3. Use Magic the Gathering API!!
3. Add multiple cards at once
3. Don't use Scanner- Dialog Boxes? JOptionPane?
4. Combine addNewCard and incrementACard into one method
5. Try/Catch exceptions (ex. wrong input)
6. Foil cards
